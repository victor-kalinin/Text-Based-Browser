  <p>Let's say there's a script <code class="java">process_four_numbers.py</code>. It takes exactly four arguments, all of which are numerical.</p> 
  <p>Inside this script, the first thing to do it is to get the arguments from the command line. Below, write a program that does so and prints them as a list.</p> 
  <p>Interaction with the command line takes place on your computer, so we can't check this task directly. So let's make it this way: instead of <code class="java">sys.argv</code>, use the predefined list <code class="java">args</code>. It contains what you would otherwise get from <code class="java">sys.argv</code>, and you should just write what you would do with it next in your program.</p> 
  <p>For example, if <code class="java">args = ["process_four_numbers.py", "1", "2", "3", "4"]</code>, then your output should be <code class="java">[1, 2, 3, 4]</code> with the list elements as numbers. Note that you <strong>are not expected</strong> to define the variable <code class="java">args</code> yourself!</p>
