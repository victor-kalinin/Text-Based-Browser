<html>
 <head></head>
 <body>
  <p>We have a dictionary <code class="language-python">squares</code> which contains numbers as keys and their squares as values. It looks like this:</p> 
  <pre><code class="language-python">squares = {1: 1, 3: 9, 5: 25, ...}</code></pre> 
  <p>Your task is to read from the input the value of the key that needs to be <em>deleted</em> from the dictionary and <em>print</em> the value of this key. If the number read from the input <em>does not exist</em> in the dictionary, then you need to <em>print</em> <code class="language-python">There is no such key</code>.</p> 
  <p>The dictionary <code class="language-python">squares</code> is already defined for you.</p>
